# Power Platform Starter Kit (Official MS Tooling Only)

This project is intended to be used as a starting point for any complex Power Platform implementation that may leverages code components - such as plugins, scripts, or PCFs.

Only official Microsoft-provided tooling is assumed, no third-party addons.

## What's in the box?

The project is organised as follows:

- build
- docs
- powerplatform
- src

Each directory contains its own README that goes into more detail about how to use it.
